      <h3>CUSP London</h3>
      <p>
       I am Director of the Centre for Urban Science and Progress London (CUSP London) at King's College London. This centre is a
       collaboration between King's, University of Warwick, and New York University, and conducts education and
       research in the area of <i>urban informatics</i>, using data-driven and novel computational techniques to study
       cities. The Centre is interdisciplinary, drawing on our strengths in computer science and artificial intelligence,
       geography and the social sciences, health and medicine, statistics, and more. It conducts both education, through
       the MSc in Urban Informatics, and research, in collaboration with city agencies and relevant non-governmental
       and industry organisations. Please see the <a href="http://cusplondon.ac.uk">CUSP London website</a> for more on our activity.
      </p>
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>My own research interests relates to multi-agent systems, particularly agent-based simulation and modelling
       norms of behaviour, and data provenance.  I have published over
       150 papers in these areas. For full details and a wider selection, please see my <a href="CV.pdf">CV</a> or <a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/simon.miles.html">my publications in KCL's publication repository</a>.
      </p>
      <p>I was an invited expert to the W3C working group on provenance, which produced a standard
       specifying how to represent provenance data for exchange online, PROV, including many supporting documents
       explaining how the provenance data may be accessed and queried, translated to other representations,
       extended, and so on.
       The specifications were published as an official W3C recommendation in April 2013.
       An overview of the specifications can be seen <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/">here</a>.
       In particular, I was co-editor of <a href = "http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-primer/">a primer on the recommended model for provenance
        data</a>. This is an accessible starting point for anyone wishing to learn about PROV.
